## Features

### Replace 'Really?' with charcter count

Makes Google Voice a little friendlier when you type more than 320 characters.

Google Voice can send out messages of up to 440 characters, spread out over 3 different texts. When you get to the third text, google adds a snarky little message saying "Really?".  This app replaces the quip with an an informative character countdown.  It lets you know how many characters are remaining so you can plan your message accordingly.

### Incrementally View Messages

Espcially since Google Voice has no way to split threads, they can sometimes get quite long.  When you want to read a message from two seconds ago, you're forced to scroll all the way down.  When you refresh the page, you're in the wrong scroll position.  This allows you to just load the most recent messages, 5 messages at a time.

### Resize Message Box

If you're going over 160 characters, it can get easy to feel lost inside of such a tiny message box.  This allows you to resize it to your comfort level.
