Friendly Voice
=============

Makes Google Voice a little friendlier when you type more than 320 characters.

Google Voice can send out messages of up to 440 characters, spread out over 3 different texts. When you get to the third text, google adds a snarky little message saying "Really?".  This app replaces the quip with an an informative character countdown.  It lets you know how many characters are remaining so you can plan your message accordingly.

The entire code is 35 lines of unminified javascript.  
You can look at it, run it on your own, or fork it from here:
